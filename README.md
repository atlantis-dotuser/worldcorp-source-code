I never thought I would throw in the towel, but things change. I went from making gamesites to working with roblox groups that have been on the news, to trying to revive Coolmathgames, to now working with one of the most powerful online groups, Retard Nation. Instead of gatekeeping my files, I'll share them. Fuck magnets. Bye.
