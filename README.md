I never thought I would throw in the towel, but things change. I went from making gamesites to working with Roblox hacking groups that have been in the news, to trying to revive Coolmathgames, and now I'm working with one of the most powerful online organizations, Retard Nation. Instead of gatekeeping my files, I'll share them. I still believe that 98% of magnets are stupid, and they can't accept someone who isn't in magnet as better than them. I'm sorry my parents didn't socially abuse me when I was younger. Good luck failing health, always remember, stay retarded. 

With much love,
